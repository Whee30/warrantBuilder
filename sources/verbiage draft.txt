# GPS TRACKER #
###############

Provided this Court authorizes the requested search for evidence previously identified herein, your Affiant respectfully requests to delay the notice of service for one hundred and eighty (180) days as outlined in §13-3919.B.  Based on your Affiant’s experience in conducting complex, non-traditional investigations, he believes his request is based on the following: often times persons involved in this type of criminal activity will not commit these types of crimes on a pattern and they may have extended periods of time between committing these crimes. Because of this, the evidence I am looking for may not be obtained within the normal time frame to return this warrant. If the order is not delayed, then there is a possibility that the device could be discovered and the evidence may not be obtained. I also request that this warrant be sealed until the completion of the investigation and the return of the search warrant.

It has been the experience of your Affiant and other investigators that to dismantle an on-going vehicle burglary enterprise, electronic surveillance techniques in the form of GPS tracking is vital for investigators to maintain a thorough investigation. These criminal organizations are aware of traditional surveillance techniques used by law enforcement and they use counter surveillance techniques to elude detection and minimize their risk of detection.
3.Therefore, your Affiant believes that allowing investigators to install, monitor both daytime and nighttime hours and replace the requested GPS tracking devices for a period of ninety (90) days could accomplish the goals of this on- going criminal investigation, in a more prudent manner than if given authorization for a shorter period of time. The tracking device may produce signals from inside private garages or other such locations not open to the public or visual surveillance. Affiant notes, however, that in some instances a GPS tracking device cannot be removed within the time period authorized by the Court due to circumstances outside the control of law enforcement.  In the event your Affiant cannot remove the device within the court-authorized time frame, your Affiant will either disable the device, if possible, or independently discontinue its monitoring.
 
Because the vehicle is sometimes parked on private property, it may be necessary to enter onto private property in order to affect the instillation, repair, replacement and removal of the tracking device. To ensure the safety of the executing officer(s) and to avoid premature disclosure of the investigation, it is requested that the court authorize installation, repair, replacement, and removal of the tracking device during both daytime and nighttime hours.
 
It has been your Affiant’s experience that interspersed within criminally-associated travel, the vehicles being electronically monitored engage in travel that is more innocuous in nature.  At the time those trips occur, the travel might not be defined as criminally-associated travel until later in the investigation.  Additionally, the travel might be innocent in nature which is typical of those not engaged in any criminal conduct.
 
As such, your Affiant wishes to notify this Court that not all of the monitored tracking will be directly or indirectly related to criminal conduct.
 
Due to the fact that officers have to locate, follow, and wait for the vehicle to be at a place for a safe instillation of the GPS tracking device, your Affiant requests 14 calendar days to serve this search warrant.
 
Allow an extended time, of 14 calendar days within issuance, for this search warrant to be served.
 
Your Affiant believes that the utilization of a GPS tracker placed on the herein identified vehicle will aid in accomplishing the goals of the investigation. Your Affiant believes that his success in furthering this investigation relies on the installation, monitoring, replacement and removal of GPS trackers on the vehicle described herein for a period of ninety days.
 
If the investigation requires a period longer than the initial request of ninety days, your Affiant will submit a search warrant requesting an extension that will detail the successes and failures of this initiating request.
 
Based on the foregoing, your Affiant respectfully requests authorization to:
Install, monitor, replace and remove (to the extent possible) GPS tracking devices on the vehicle described herein for a period not to exceed ninety days (90), unless an extension is authorized by this Court;
-Install, monitor, replace and remove the GPS tracking devices during nighttime and day time hours;
-Delay the notice of service for a period of one hundred and eighty days (180).
-Serve this search warrant within 14 calendar days of issuance.

For these reasons, I believe that the installation of such a device on these vehicles will lead to evidence, fruits and instrumentalities of the crime (s) of VIOLATION OF Burglary, Trafficking in stolen property and theft laws.

These devices will allow Officers to monitor the location of the vehicle, in an attempt to identify other locations and individuals who are engaged in the commission of these crimes.

It may be necessary to enter onto private property and/or move the vehicle in order to effect the installation, repair, replacement and removal of the tracking device. In the event that a malfunction occurs with the device, or the batteries powering the device need to be changed, we request that the court authorize law enforcement officers and their agents to remove and replace the device as needed subject to the limitations listed in this court order. It is further requested that the court authorize the installation of the device during both daytime and nighttime hours to decrease the likelihood of detection during the installation.

In the event that the Court grants this application, there will be periodic monitoring of this tracking device during both daytime and nighttime hours for a period of 60 days following the installation of the device. The tracking device may produce signals from inside private garages or other such locations not open to the public or visual surveillance.

If the operational needs of the investigation require the GPS device to remain on the vehicle longer than 60 days, the affiant, or other qualified personnel, will present to the court a report, before the 60 day period has elapsed, on the continuing nature of the investigation and the use of the GPS tracking device to date. The court, at that time, may authorize the continued installation, monitoring and recording of information through the use of a GPS tracking device, upon additional finding of probable cause, incorporating the information contained in the original affidavit, for an additional 60 day period.

It is requested that the warrant and the accompanying affidavit in support thereof, as they reveal an ongoing investigation, be sealed until further order of the court. This request is made based on the continuing nature of the criminal investigation. Should this type of covert surveillance information be accessible to the public during the course of the investigation, it could jeopardize the success of the investigation, place law enforcement officers in danger, and increase the risk of flight from fugitives.

Your honor, I respectfully request that the court issue a warrant authorizing the members of the Special Investigations Unit, including, but not limited to, other law enforcement agents and technicians assisting in the above described investigation, to install a tracking device in or on the above mentioned vehicle, within 5 calendar days of the issuance of the requested warrant, and to remove the tracking device from the vehicle once the use of this device has ended. The return of the warrant and the written inventory of the monitored GPS information shall be completed within three court business days after the completion of the last authorized 60 day GPS installation, monitoring and recording period.
