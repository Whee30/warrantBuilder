The first version of this project was born into PySimpleGUI. After they went closed source, I pivoted to PyQT6. The interface is cleaner, but the progress stalled while the learning curve spiked.

The goal is to have a self-contained application to speed along the process of warrant writing so that the "boots on the ground" can focus on the facts of the case vs. finding the right template from someone's thumbdrive. 

Open to suggestions, this isn't intended as a public release, however if someone else gets use of it please let me know!
