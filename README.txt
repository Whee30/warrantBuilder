Ideas:

items to search for chosen by checkbox, populating a variable array to them pull the relevant data text files from

GUI could show a running tally of items to populate in full text form, editable (or not). Would definitely need a clear button for this.

Need to account for multiple people, multiple houses and multiple vehicles. +, - buttons that add a spot into an array

need to test populating {{tag}} with more than one variable to account for multiple people or multiple vehicles

need to test removal of empty {{tag}} values
	Does it clear these automagically????

Set up a github repository for the files, build in an updater function to download a local copy of files.
